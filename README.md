# About:
Wordle: Python Edition is a desktop version of well known game by Josh Wardle (avaliable at www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). 
This version allows you to freely setup both game length (by changeing maximall amount of guesses) and lenght of word you need to guess.

# How to play?
In general, your tast is to guess a five letter English word. Each time you enter the word you'll get an info for each letter of the word you entered:
 - If the letter occurs in word you need to guess and it is in correct place (first, second and so on) - you'll see a green box
 - If the letter occurs in word you need to guess, but in other place - you'll see a yellow box
 - if the letter doesn't occurs in word you need to guess - you'll se a grey box
 
 By default, you have a total of six guesses. After six attempts the game will end.
